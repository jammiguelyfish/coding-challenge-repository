# coding-challenge-repository
This is a repository for a coding challenge composed of 3 problem sets.

Below is the structure of the repository:

coding-challenge-repository
│ README.md
│
├── problem_set_1
│ │ palindrome_pairs.py
│ │ README.md
│
├── problem_set_2
│ │ valid_parentheses.py
│ │ README.md
│
├── problem_set_3
│ │ longest_increasing_subsequence.py
│ │ README.md


Navigate to each problem_set_<#> folder for each coding challenge problem. Each has their own README file explaining the problem and the approach to solving it.


## **Python Version**
All source codes were ran in Python 3.10.8

You can download the version here to make sure the code runs properly. 
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3108/

Tutorial on how to install Python in local windows machine:

## **Running the Code**
Each python file in the problem sets are in a single script. Assuming that python is already installed in your local machine, downloading the *.py file and running it will do the work.

- *Running using CLI / Terminal*
    -   using a command line interface or a terminal (cmd, git bash, etc.) you can run the code using:
    -   example problem_set_1 using absolute path:
            ```python <path_to_file>\palindrome_pairs.py```
    -   example when already in directory of python file:
            ```python palindrome_pairs.py```

- *Running using an IDE or VScode*
    -   an IDE have a run button in order to run the code which will also have their own terminal where output will be shown.
        Example IDE - PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
   
    -   you can also use VScode to run your code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
